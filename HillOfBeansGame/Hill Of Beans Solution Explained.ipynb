This document will go through the step-by-step thought process on creating the game and assumes the reader knows some basics behind programming, specifically in the Pythong programming language.\n\n## The Game\nConsider a game in which two players compete over a hill of beans.  The players take turns removing a number of beans from the hill.  On any one turn, a player must take at least one, and no more than three beans.  When a player removes a bean from the hill, he or she places it in the bean receptacle shared by both players.  The player who removes the last bean or beans gets to keep all of the beans.\n\n## Background\nReading the above premis, we can get a pretty thorough list of the rules of the game:\n\n\n*   There are two players\n*   Turns are alternating\n*   Players must take at least one bean but not more than 3 or the number remaining, whichever is lower\n*   The player that takes the last bean wins the game\n\nSome things to remember while we're working:\n\n*   We can start with either a set number of beans or specify at runtime\n*   We don't necessarily know who is playing but we could figure it out at a later time\n\n## The Setup\nWe're going to start with what we know we need before we actually play the game:\n\n*   How many beans there are to start out with\n*   The minimum number that the player should take\n*   The maximum number that the player shoudl take\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"totalBeansLeft = 15\nmaxBeansToTake = 3\nminBeansToTake = 1\nnumberOfTurns = 0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"thBu0jziRdoX"},"source":"## Defining the Turn and Coding the Game\nWe already know how a single turn goes:\n\n\n1.   Player looks at how many beans there are\n2.   Player decides to take \"X\" number of beans from the pile, making sure they're taking the correct number\n3.   The turn passes to the next player\n\nWe can encompass all of these steps into a single loop that will iterate until there are no more beans left to take.\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"There are 15 beans left...\n"},{"ename":"StdinNotImplementedError","evalue":"raw_input was called, but this frontend does not support input requests.","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[1;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mStdinNotImplementedError\u001b[0m                  Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[1;32m<ipython-input-5-f32c130faacb>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[1;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m      2\u001b[0m   \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;34m\"There are %d beans left...\"\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m%\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtotalBeansLeft\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m----> 4\u001b[1;33m   \u001b[0mnumToTake\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mint\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0minput\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;34m\"How many do you want to take? \"\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m      6\u001b[0m   \u001b[1;32mif\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnumToTake\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m>\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtotalBeansLeft\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m \u001b[1;32mor\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnumToTake\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m>\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmaxBeansToTake\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m:\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[1;32m~\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python37\\site-packages\\ipykernel\\kernelbase.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mraw_input\u001b[1;34m(self, prompt)\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m    853\u001b[0m         \u001b[1;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[1;32mnot\u001b[0m \u001b[0mself\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0m_allow_stdin\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m:\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m    854\u001b[0m             raise StdinNotImplementedError(\n\u001b[1;32m--> 855\u001b[1;33m                 \u001b[1;34m\"raw_input was called, but this frontend does not support input requests.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0;32m    856\u001b[0m             )\n\u001b[0;32m    857\u001b[0m         return self._input_request(str(prompt),\n","\u001b[1;31mStdinNotImplementedError\u001b[0m: raw_input was called, but this frontend does not support input requests."]}],"source":"while totalBeansLeft > 0:\n  print(\"There are %d beans left...\" %totalBeansLeft)\n  \n  numToTake = int(input(\"How many do you want to take? \"))\n  \n  if(numToTake > totalBeansLeft) or (numToTake > maxBeansToTake):\n    print(\"You can't take that many.... try again...\")\n  elif numToTake < minBeansToTake:\n    print(\"You have to take at least %d beans...\" % minBeansToTake)\n  else:\n    totalBeansLeft -= numToTake\n    numberOfTurns += 1\n    \nprint(\"The game has been won after %d turns!\" % numberOfTurns)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"cDYiN4rYWC6Y"},"source":"## Incorporating \"Artificial Intelligence\"\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, can be found in a lot of the things that we interact with today.
